## Task 3: Design a Data collection tool to record Typhoid Fever symptoms Data

I have designed data collection tool using [Clappia.](https://www.clappia.com/) The designed tool can be used both online as well as offline. 

The tool is highly customable. We can create a custom form using various data input as well as data upload blocks as per our need.

We can collect data without the internet. Data gets stored locally and is synced to the cloud whenever the user is back in an internet zone.

We can export the data in Excel format.

We can also connect a Google Sheet to which this data is pushed in real-time
