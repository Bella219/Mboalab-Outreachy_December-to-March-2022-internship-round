"Create a logo for the project"

Although I have no design experience, I had an idea that can be explored with someone more skilled in the visual field.
A lamp was created representing innovation, ideas and the object's color represents Yaound√©, Cameroon.
I believe that the idea fits into the project proposal, which is through science and innovation to improve the quality of life
