I tried to kept my logo as simple as possible.

I kept in mind  the aim of MboaLab during the creation pf this logo which is:  to catalyse sustainable local development and improve peopleâ€™s living conditions through open science , provide community and lifelong education for the population, as well as formal education for the younger generations,
propose solutions that meet the needs of communities, using local knowledge and open digital technologies;
raise public awareness of environmental issues;
facilitate access to basic health care.

keeping these aims in mind the only image I could imagine is the image of unity ands togetherness , which my logo clearly represents.
